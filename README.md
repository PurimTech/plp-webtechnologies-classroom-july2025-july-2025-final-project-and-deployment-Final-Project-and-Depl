# StimaOne ⚡

**StimaOne** is a Kenya-focused energy platform that helps households and small businesses **analyze power bills, track outages, book verified fundis, and explore solar savings** — all from one dashboard.  

This project was built as part of a web development assignment to showcase **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, responsive design, and GitHub deployment**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Image Slider:** Interactive carousel with local images to make the homepage engaging.  
- **Responsive Layout:** Works smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
